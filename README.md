## Introduction

Welcome to the Cricket Analysis project, a data science endeavor aimed at leveraging advanced analytics to identify the best 11 players for a cricket team. This project uses historical cricket data to make informed decisions about player selection based on their performance metrics.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to utilize data science techniques to analyze the performance of cricket players and create a model that can assist in selecting the best 11 players for a match. By evaluating player statistics, match conditions, and other relevant factors, this project aims to provide valuable insights to team selectors and management.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Fetches cricket match data from reliable sources.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans, organizes, and prepares the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates relevant features and metrics for player performance evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Develops predictive models to rank and select players based on their statistics.
- **Visualization:** Generates graphs and charts for better understanding of player performance.
- **User Interface (UI):** Provides a user-friendly interface to input match conditions and get player recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/Krishnalilahane/Cricket_analysis`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cricket-analysis`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary data. You can either use the provided sample data or gather your own.
2. Run the data preprocessing scripts to clean and structure the data.
3. Use the feature engineering scripts to create relevant metrics for player evaluation.
4. Train and evaluate different machine learning models using the prepared data.
5. Use the UI to input match conditions and get player recommendations.

## Data

The data for this project can be obtained from various sources, including APIs and online repositories. Sample data is provided in the `data` directory to help you understand the expected format.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Fetch and organize historical match data, including player statistics and match conditions.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Calculate performance metrics like batting average, bowling strike rate, fielding efficiency, etc.
4. **Model Development:** Train machine learning models using appropriate algorithms (e.g., regression, classification).
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision-recall).
6. **User Interface:** Create a user interface for inputting match conditions and obtaining player recommendations.

## Results

The project aims to provide a ranked list of players based on their performance metrics and match conditions. The accuracy of player selection can be evaluated using historical match data and comparing the recommendations with the actual team selections.
